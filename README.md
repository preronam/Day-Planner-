This is a Day Planner powered by jQuery. The planner has the following features:

1. Stores events occuring from 9:00AM - 5:00PM for a given day
2. Stores multiple events for the same time slot
3. Saves events to their designated time slot and local storage, allowing the user to access the information after the session is over

To develop this project, the following processes were implemented:
1. HTML was created for the general markup of the page
2. Bootstrap was used to style the layout of the planner
3. An external CSS file was used to add more styles to the planner
4. jQuery was used to add functionality such as recognizing and storing events
5. Moment.js was used to capture the currentDate and currentTime for the events
